- ðŸ’¾ Results export functionality

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.11
- Streamlit
- TensorFlow
- Scikit-learn
- Biopython
- Plotly
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/viral-biomarker-discovery.git
cd viral-biomarker-discovery
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required packages:
